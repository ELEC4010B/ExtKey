However, text input is inefficient for either tablet or smart phone alone. For example, we need to switch mode of keyboard when we want to type numbers or symbols in the middle of inputting characters, and we need to hold down the screen for a long time to move the cursor around, which is very inconvenient. On the other hand, we note that while using one of the devices (e.g., the tablet), the other (i.e., the smartphone) is “wasted”, just sitting aside doing nothing. Therefore we thought of making use of the idle smartphone as a extended keyboard for the tablet.\r\n\r\n# Merits\r\nWe want to improve the input efficiency by using both the tablet PC and the smart phone. Through using this set of apps, the users will be able to enjoy a faster numerical input and an easier cursor movement.\r\n\r\n# Aim\r\nThis course project is to develop a pair of applications that allow a tablet PC and a smart phone to cooperate to provide extended input functionalities.\r\n\r\n# Methodology\r\n## Overview\r\nAt the beginning, a smartphone installed with the phone side client and a tablet PC installed with the tablet side client are present. A Bluetooth connection is setup between these two devices, and then whatever is typed on the number pad or whatever cursor moving instruction is performed on the trackpad displayed on the phone side will instantly be reflected in the textbox on the tablet side, therefore allowing simultaneous input from both the tablet's own on-screen keyboard and the extended keyboard on the smartphone, eliminating the need for switching the input mode of the tablet.\r\n## Phone Side\r\nThe Bluetooth connection is initiated by the phone side. Click \"Connect\" to search for all available devices, and choose the tablet installed with the tablet side client. After that, you may switch the operation mode of the phone side client based on orientation: number pad for portrait, and trackpad for landscape. In number pad mode, each input character is sent to the tablet through Bluetooth. In trackpad mode, use single finger movement to navigate the cursor on the tablet side, and two fingers movement to select texts. The touch event is then converted to an instruction in String format and sent to the tablet side. The phone side client also uses wakelock to keep the screen on.\r\n## Tablet Side\r\nThe tablet side client is idle, listening to the phone side's connection request at the beginning. After properly setting up a connection socket, the status will be changed to \"connected\", and you can type with both the on-screen keyboard and the extended keyboard on the phone. Any input character from the phone will be directly inserted to the current cursor position, and any trackpad instruction is interpreted instantly. Upon text selection, you can press the menu button to call out the cut-copy-paste menu. At the end you may choose to save what you have typed to a text file on your SD card.\r\n\r\n# Demonstration Video\r\nPlease insert the video frame here.\r\n\r\n# Conclusion\r\nThis project has created a pair of collaborating Android applications that can significantly improve input efficiency on a tablet PC. These two apps use Bluetooth Serial Profile to communicate with each other, and can cooperate to enable you to input characters and numbers/symbols without having to switch keyboard mode. We believe that you will enjoy using our apps!\r\n\r\n# Downloads\r\n## Phone Side Client\r\nInsert direct link here\r\n## Tablet Side Client\r\nInsert direct link here\r\n## Source Codes\r\n### Phone Side\r\n* [Download ZIP](https://github.com/ELEC4010B/ExtKey/zipball/master)\r\n* [Download TAR](https://github.com/ELEC4010B/ExtKey/tarball/master)\r\n* [View On GitHub](https://github.com/ELEC4010B/ExtKey)\r\n\r\n### Tablet Side\r\n* [Download ZIP](https://github.com/ELEC4010B/ExtKeyTab/zipball/master)\r\n* [Download TAR](https://github.com/ELEC4010B/ExtKeyTab/tarball/master)\r\n* [View On GitHub](https://github.com/ELEC4010B/ExtKeyTab)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
