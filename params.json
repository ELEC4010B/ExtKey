{"name":"Extended Keyboard","tagline":"The following links are for the PHONE SIDE only:","body":"# Welcome to the Project Website of Extended Keyboard!\r\nThis is the project website for Extended Keyboard, a team course project for ELEC4010B: Mobile Embedded Systems (Spring 2014) done by LI, Wenjin (10610750) (@jj1118) and WONG, Rufus Cheuk-yin (20101989) (@rcywongaa).\r\n\r\n# Motivation\r\nNowadays many people have both a tablet PC and a smart phone. However, text input is inefficient for either tablet or smart phone alone. For example, we need to switch mode of keyboard when we want to type numbers or symbols in the middle of inputting characters, and we need to hold down the screen for a long time to move the cursor around, which is very inconvenient. On the other hand, we note that while using one of the devices (e.g., the tablet), the other (i.e., the smartphone) is “wasted”, just sitting aside doing nothing. Therefore we thought of making use of the idle smartphone as a extended keyboard for the tablet.\r\n\r\n# Merits\r\nWe want to improve the input efficiency by using both the tablet PC and the smart phone. Through using this set of apps, the users will be able to enjoy a faster numerical input and an easier cursor movement.\r\n\r\n# Aim\r\nThis course project is to develop a pair of applications that allow a tablet PC and a smart phone to cooperate to provide extended input functionalities.\r\n\r\n# Methodology (Please enrich the following key points)\r\n## Overview\r\nBluetooth connection, inter-device cooperation, etc.\r\n## Phone Side\r\nInitiating connection, sending messages, etc.\r\n## Tablet Side\r\nAccepting connection, receiving and interpreting messages, appending characters, moving the cursor, save text, etc.\r\n\r\n# Demonstration Video\r\nPlease insert the video frame or link here.\r\n\r\n# Conclusion\r\nThis project has created a pair of collaborating Android applications that can significantly improve input efficiency on a tablet PC. These two apps use Bluetooth Serial Profile to communicate with each other, and can cooperate to enable you to input characters and numbers/symbols without having to switch keyboard mode. We believe that you will enjoy using our apps!\r\n\r\n# Note\r\nThe links on the left of this page will bring you to the Git project of the **phone side** client, where you may view and download the APK file and project source codes.
