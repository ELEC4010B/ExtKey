<p>This is the project website for Extended Keyboard, a team course project for ELEC4010B: Mobile Embedded Systems (Spring 2014) done by LI, Wenjin (10610750) (<a href="https://github.com/jj1118" class="user-mention">@jj1118</a>) and WONG, Rufus Cheuk-yin (20101989) (<a href="https://github.com/rcywongaa" class="user-mention">@rcywongaa</a>).</p>

<a name="motivation" class="anchor" href="#motivation"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Motivation</h1>

<p>Nowadays many people have both a tablet PC and a smart phone. However, text input is inefficient for either tablet or smart phone alone. For example, we need to switch mode of keyboard when we want to type numbers or symbols in the middle of inputting characters, and we need to hold down the screen for a long time to move the cursor around, which is very inconvenient. On the other hand, we note that while using one of the devices (e.g., the tablet), the other (i.e., the smartphone) is “wasted”, just sitting aside doing nothing. Therefore we thought of making use of the idle smartphone as a extended keyboard for the tablet.</p>

<a name="merits" class="anchor" href="#merits"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Merits</h1>

<p>We want to improve the input efficiency by using both the tablet PC and the smart phone. Through using this set of apps, the users will be able to enjoy a faster numerical input and an easier cursor movement.</p>

<a name="aim" class="anchor" href="#aim"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Aim</h1>

<p>This course project is to develop a pair of applications that allow a tablet PC and a smart phone to cooperate to provide extended input functionalities.</p>

<a name="methodology" class="anchor" href="#methodology"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Methodology</h1>

<h2>
<a name="overview" class="anchor" href="#overview"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Overview</h2>

<p>At the beginning, a smartphone installed with the phone side client and a tablet PC installed with the tablet side client are present. A Bluetooth connection is setup between these two devices, and then whatever is typed on the number pad or whatever cursor moving instruction is performed on the trackpad displayed on the phone side will instantly be reflected in the textbox on the tablet side, therefore allowing simultaneous input from both the tablet's own on-screen keyboard and the extended keyboard on the smartphone, eliminating the need for switching the input mode of the tablet.</p>

<h2>
<a name="phone-side" class="anchor" href="#phone-side"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Phone Side</h2>

<p>The Bluetooth connection is initiated by the phone side. Click "Connect" to search for all available devices, and choose the tablet installed with the tablet side client. After that, you may switch the operation mode of the phone side client based on orientation: number pad for portrait, and trackpad for landscape. In number pad mode, each input character is sent to the tablet through Bluetooth. In trackpad mode, use single finger movement to navigate the cursor on the tablet side, and two fingers movement to select texts. The touch event is then converted to an instruction in String format and sent to the tablet side. The phone side client also uses wakelock to keep the screen on.</p>

<h2>
<a name="tablet-side" class="anchor" href="#tablet-side"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Tablet Side</h2>

<p>The tablet side client is idle, listening to the phone side's connection request at the beginning. After properly setting up a connection socket, the status will be changed to "connected", and you can type with both the on-screen keyboard and the extended keyboard on the phone. Any input character from the phone will be directly inserted to the current cursor position, and any trackpad instruction is interpreted instantly. Upon text selection, you can press the menu button to call out the cut-copy-paste menu. At the end you may choose to save what you have typed to a text file on your SD card.</p>

<a name="conclusion" class="anchor" href="#conclusion"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Conclusion</h1>

<p>This project has created a pair of collaborating Android applications that can significantly improve input efficiency on a tablet PC. These two apps use Bluetooth Serial Profile to communicate with each other, and can cooperate to enable you to input characters and numbers/symbols without having to switch keyboard mode. We believe that you will enjoy using our apps!</p>

<ol>
<li>Download the two APK files from above links and install them on appropriate devices. You may need to allow installation from unknown sources in your system settings.</li>
<li>Switch on Bluetooth on both your tablet PC and smartphone.</li>
<li>Open both apps.</li>
<li>Click "Connect" on your phone to search for all available Bluetooth devices. Choose your tablet PC.</li>
<li>Wait for the status on your tablet PC to change to "Connected" and the phone side will automatically enter the extended keyboard.</li>
<li>Put your phone in portrait mode to enable the number pad for numerical and symbolic input.</li>
<li>Put your phone in landscape mode to enable the trackpad: single finger swipe to move the cursor on the tablet PC, and two finger swipe to toggle text selection.</li>
<li>Upon text selection on your tablet PC, you may click the menu button and cut or copy the highlighted text, and click the menu button again and paste it to your desired position. The menu will also automatically come up upon text selection request from the trackpad on your smartphone.</li>
<li>When you finish typing, you may save the text to your SD card by clicking "Save" on your tablet and giving a filename. You can find the saved file under the directory "/sdcard/Extended Keyboard".</li>
